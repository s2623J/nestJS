    NestJS Notes:
    -------------

    Defintion:
        Very similar to Angular
        Includes RxJS (uses Observables)

    Setup:
        Install nest globally: "npm i -g @nestjs/cli"
        Create scaffolding for new app: "nest new nest-todo-app"
        cd into app directory
        Iniialize with: "npm run start:dev" (will auto-refresh on save)
        Navigate to: "localhost:3000" to see "Hello World!"

    CLI:
        Generate modules with: "nest g module <module_name>"
        Generate controller with: "nest g controller <controllers_name>"
        Generate service with: "nest g service <service_name>"

    Controllers:
        Should hold All of the routes (Find under the "@GET" section inside 
            the "@Controller" section)

    Services:
        Contain a "@Injectable()" decorator that indicates that it is built 
            to be injected into other modules and controllers
        
    Models:
        Cannot be auto-generated by CLI 
        Are simple exported interfaces of descibed data types
        Must manually add a "model" directory with a ".model.ts" file
